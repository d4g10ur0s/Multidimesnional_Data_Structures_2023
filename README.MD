# General Info
The purpose of this computer science project is to present the focuses on optimizing range and similarity queries on text datasets using quadratic trees, range trees, and R-trees. The project aims to compare the performance of these tree-based data structures in terms of query processing time, space complexity, and accuracy.

```
2. Run Scripts
  - First cd to the scripts directory. Then run the following commands
```
./run_scrapy.sh
./run_preprocess.sh
```
